# Architecture 


Class Menu to interface with Board Size , Number of Bombs and Change Board Values


class Tile
class Board 
class Menu
class Minesweeper 


# Menu, pygame-menu
https://pygame-menu.readthedocs.io/en/4.2.8/


add a decorator when a Tile is supposed to be rendered
    When a click even happens on Board we start exploring the board to see which tiles should open
    Then each Tile should switch its status to clicked and reveal its content.
    

debug width and height (play with dimensions)

maybe we can remove Board class or merge it with Menu.

DEFAULT SETTINGS
    MODE: EASY, TILE_SIZE = 30
    CREATE MENU OBJECT
    CREATE BOARD OBJECT

ON CHANGE MODE
    CHANGE MENU ITEM
    DELETE BOARD OBJECT 
    CREATE NEW BOARD OBJECT
