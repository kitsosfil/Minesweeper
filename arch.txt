add a decorator when a Tile is supposed to be rendered

debug width and height (play with dimensions)
create fake screen
    scale it to the display()
    scale tile size as well

maybe we can remove Board class or merge it with Menu.

DEFAULT SETTINGS
    MODE: EASY, TILE_SIZE = 30
    CREATE MENU OBJECT
    CREATE BOARD OBJECT

DRAW RESOLUTION ON DEFAULT MODE
    FAKE SCREEN ON PYGAME.display
    PASS AROUND FAKE SCREEN AND RENDER IT ?

ON WINDOW RESIZE EVENT
    - GET WIDTH 
    - FIND APPROPRIATE HEIGHT TO KEEP ASPECT RATIO 
    - CHANGE TILE SIZE TO FIT TO SCREEN
    - DRAW ON FAKE SCREEN
    - RENDER ON WINDOW

ON CHANGE MODE
    CHANGE MENU ITEM
    DELETE BOARD OBJECT 
    CREATE NEW BOARD OBJECT
